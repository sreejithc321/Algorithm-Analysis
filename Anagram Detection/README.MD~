One string is an anagram of another if the second is simply a rearrangement of the first. 

For example : 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams
              'python' and 'typhon' are anagrams 

assumption : Strings are of equal length 
             Strings are made up of symbols from the set of 26 lowercase alphabetic characters. 

Aim : Write a boolean function that will take two strings and return whether they are anagrams.
